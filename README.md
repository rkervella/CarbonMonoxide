# CarbonMonoxide
EDR Evasion - Combination of SwampThing - TikiTorch

Work in progess.

Essentially combining these elements:

```
1. PPID Spoofing
2. CmdLine Spoofing
3. QAPC Injection


```

Its a bit easier than I thought. I went ahead and submitted a PR request.  The code here is just fragments. 

https://github.com/rasta-mouse/TikiTorch/pull/13

See this for example.

After experimentation, I settled on c# Optional Parameters to satsify this requirement.

Just an example of how to use. You can choose whatever parameters you like for the starting process.

Special Thanks to fuzzysec/rastamouse for their code and projects.  This isn't really anything new. Its simply an adaptation.
